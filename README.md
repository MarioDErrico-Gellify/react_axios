# react_axios

# Created with CodeSandbox

This repository is a showcase project developed as part of my application process for a potential role at humans.tech. The project is currently a work in progress, and I am continuously working on enhancing its features and functionality. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in React, hooks, routing, and internationalization (i18n), as well as my ability to work with APIs using Axios.

# ShowCase

# Key Features:

React Hooks: Various hooks have been implemented to manage state and side effects.
React Router: The application uses React Router for navigation and route management.
Internationalization (i18n): The i18n setup is partially implemented and will be fully integrated soon.
Axios: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.

# Styled Components:

The application uses Styled Components for styling, intentionally skipping frameworks like Material UI or other pre-built component libraries. This choice was made to have more control over the styling and to customize the look and feel of the application more flexibly.
Current Status:

Work in Progress: Some features, such as internationalization and certain hooks, are still being finalized.
Future Improvements:

Further optimization and testing are planned to ensure the app is fully functional and ready for production.
